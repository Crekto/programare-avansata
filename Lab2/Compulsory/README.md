<ul>
<li>Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: <i>Event, Room</i>. <br>
The start and end time will be integers. The rooms will also have the property <i>type</i>. The available types will be implemented as an <i>enum </i>.

</li><li> Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters. <br>Use the <a href="https://netbeans.org/features/java/editor.html"> IDE features</a> for code generation,
such as <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/roumen/netbeans-quick-tip-2-generating-getters-and-setters">generating getters and setters</a>.

</li><li> The <i>toString</i> method form the <i>Object</i> class must be properly overridden for all the classes. <br>
Use the <a href="https://netbeans.org/features/java/editor.html"> IDE features</a> for code generation, for example (in NetBeans)  press <i>Alt+Ins</i> or invoke the context menu, 
select "Insert Code" and then "toString()" (or simply start typing "toString" and then press <i>Ctrl+Space</i>).

</li><li>Create and print on the screen the objects in the example.
</li></ul>
