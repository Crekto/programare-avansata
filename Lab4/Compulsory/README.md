# Pavel Petronel 2A3


<ul>
<li>Create a Maven project.
</li><li>Create an object-oriented model of the problem. Streets have names and lengths, intersections have names. A street joins two intersections.
<!-- You should have at least the following classes: <i>Street, Intersection, City</i> and the main class. <br/> -->
</li><li>Create the streets and the intersections of the problem described in the example. Use <i>streams</i> in order to easily create the intersections.
</li><li>Create a <i>list</i> of streets, using  <i>LinkedList</i> implementation and sort it by the length, using a <i>comparator</i> expressed as a <i>lambda-expression</i> or <i>method reference</i>.
Make sure all the objects are <i>comparable</i>.
</li><li>Create a <i>set</i> of intersections, using a <i>HashSet</i> implementation. Verify the property that a <i>Set</i> does not contain duplicates.
<!-- <li>Iterate through both collections and print on the screen their elements, one by one.  -->
<!-- <li>Create two <i>maps</i> (having different implementations) describing the students and the school preferences and print them on the screen. -->
<!-- Use two different implementation of <i>lists</i> in order to specify the preferences. Print them on the screen. -->
<!-- Generate a large, random instance of the problem. -->
